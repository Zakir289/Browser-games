#### Few points that I thought of sharing:

- **HTML** code alone never looks appealing. Adding **CSS** to HTML will solve the problem.  To apply CSS to the HTML elements I had divided the page as left column and right column and wrapped in a div so that applying styles can be done comfortabily.


- The **CSS** is applied through **class, id, tag names, inline css..** . Using class names will help you to reuse the css for other HTML elements, which will reduce the amount of data loading on the browser and provides readabilty of code. Among all the methods for applying the css there will be priorities for the browser which one to pick when there is collision of properties.


- Our built in viewer is 632px, so lets make the web page width 632px. As I was thinking to make the left column more wider than the right column, I had divided area as 300px and 270px. But using pixel values directly is not a good idea as there will different sizes of the resolutions. So I thought using the **percentage** to divide the page, as it can render perfectly on any resolution.



- All the div elements will be in vertical column because of static positining, But never the time it looks nice. The solution comes from "float" attribute. when **float:left or float:right** are applied to the div, The div's will take enough shape and looks fascinating.



- If we don't give proper **margin** to the page, The wrapper div will be to the left most side of the page. It can be restricted to the center of the page by using "margin:auto" and Now the complete information will be at the center of the page. The other area can be used for Google AD words or to show any adds about the site. 



- Giving **paddings** to a particular HTML element is always an important factor, If not the data or enclosed elements will not be properly arranged and will stick to the left or top of the element. Using "text-align" attribute will help you to align the text properly. 



- If top and left padding are not applied to the inner div's they will be so close to the side borders. And doing the same to the navigator and footer will make the page more fascinating.



- Giving back ground to the div where ever necessery, and especially the **color of the border** will make the difference in presenting the information. It helps to differentiate the data on the page.



- **Linking to the social networking** sites will help you to present yourself more clearly to others. If you are working on  any ecomerce site or any site which needs user details to be entered, **you can give an easy option to the customer to let us know his details, So that he can get rid of entering sign up details and can have an account on our site.** Thouse plugins will be provided by many sites like facebook, Twitter, Linkdin...
